# Crisis Navigator — Comprehensive Report (PPT-Ready)

This document provides a structured outline and key content to build a presentation deck about the Crisis Navigator project. Use these slides as a starting point.

---

## 1. Title Slide
- **Crisis Navigator**
- **AI-powered Emergency Response Coordination Platform**
- Team/Author, Date

---

## 2. Problem Statement
- Disasters and emergencies require rapid, coordinated response
- Information is fragmented: multiple channels, languages, and media (text/images)
- Delays in triage and communication increase risk and damage
- Need a centralized, intelligent system to collect, assess, and disseminate critical information fast

---

## 3. Solution Overview
- Web platform for citizens and responders to report, track, and manage emergencies
- AI-powered analysis of reports and images to triage severity and recommend actions
- Real-time communication via SMS and Slack
- Translation to bridge language barriers
- Analytics dashboard for trends and risk prediction

---

## 4. Key Features
- **User Auth**: register, login, session-based access
- **Emergency Reporting**: text + optional image, location, geocoordinates
- **AI Analysis (Gemini)**: severity, category, urgency, recommendations, ETA
- **Image Analysis**: hazard recognition and context
- **Crisis Map**: visualize incidents, shelters, and alerts
- **Notifications**: Twilio SMS (single/bulk), Slack posts with actions
- **Translation**: multilingual support via Gemini
- **Analytics**: trend analysis, risk prediction, insights dashboard

---

## 5. Architecture
- **Frontend**: Flask + Jinja templates, Bootstrap CSS
- **Backend**: Flask routes and services
- **AI Services**: Google GenAI (Gemini 2.5 models)
- **Messaging Integrations**: Twilio, Slack SDK
- **Database**: SQLite via SQLAlchemy
- **Storage**: Local uploads/ (images), instance/ (DB)

Diagram idea:
- Browser -> Flask (routes.py)
- Flask -> Services: gemini_service, analytics_service, translation_service, sms_service, slack_integration
- Flask -> SQLAlchemy (models) -> SQLite
- Flask -> Static/templates

---

## 6. Data Model
- **User**: username, email, phone, location, password_hash
- **EmergencyReport**: title, description, lat/lon, image_path, severity, status, ai_analysis, timestamps
- **Alert**: title, description, type, severity, location, radius, active, timestamps
- **Shelter**: name, address, lat/lon, capacity, occupancy, facilities

Show ERD-style diagram or table to visualize relationships (User 1–N EmergencyReport).

---

## 7. AI Capabilities
- **Text Analysis (gemini_service.analyze_emergency_report)**
  - Input: description, optional location
  - Output: severity, category, urgency, confidence, recommendations, response time
- **Image Analysis (gemini_service.analyze_emergency_image)**
  - Input: image bytes + prompt
  - Output: descriptive analysis with hazards
- **Summarization (generate_emergency_summary)**
  - Input: recent reports
  - Output: concise dashboard summary
- **Translation (translation_service)**
  - Realtime JSON API: detected_language, translated_text, confidence
- **Analytics (analytics_service)**
  - TrendAnalysis: direction, severity distribution, hotspots, insights
  - EmergencyPrediction: risk level, predicted incidents, high-risk areas

---

## 8. Core Flows
1. **User registers and logs in**
2. **Submits a report** (optional image, lat/lon)
3. **AI analysis** determines severity/category/urgency
4. **Notifications**: SMS to user and bulk alerts for critical cases; Slack post for team
5. **Map** displays incidents, shelters, alerts
6. **Analytics** page shows trends and predictions

---

## 9. Security & Privacy
- Secrets via environment variables (never committed)
- File upload restrictions: allowed types and size cap (16MB)
- Session secret configurable
- Consider HTTPS, WAF, and rate limiting in production
- PII minimization; logs avoid sensitive content

---

## 10. Deployment
- Python 3.11+, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set environment variables (Gemini, Twilio, Slack, SESSION_SECRET)
- SQLite out of the box; can migrate to Postgres/MySQL
- Run behind a reverse proxy; consider `gunicorn` for prod

---

## 11. Demo Plan
- Register/login
- Submit a report with and without image
- Show AI analysis & dashboard summary
- Trigger SMS (simulate if credentials absent)
- Send to Slack (show channel message)
- Open map and analytics

---

## 12. Results & Impact
- Faster triage with structured AI outputs
- Centralized communication via Slack/SMS
- Actionable analytics for preparedness
- Multilingual support reduces barriers in emergencies

---

## 13. Roadmap
- Role-based access control (Admin/Responder/Citizen)
- Geofencing and real distance calculations for alerts
- Offline/mobile app support
- Integration with public alert feeds (e.g., CAP)
- Advanced computer vision for damage assessment
- Kubernetes/Cloud deployment, monitoring, and autoscaling

---

## 14. Risks & Mitigations
- AI hallucination → confidence scores, human-in-the-loop, guardrails
- Service outages (Twilio/Slack/Gemini) → graceful fallbacks
- Data privacy → strict logging and access controls
- Scalability → move to managed DB and queuing (Celery/RQ)

---

## 15. Appendix: Key Endpoints
- Pages: `/`, `/register`, `/login`, `/dashboard`, `/report`, `/map`, `/analytics`, `/voice-report`
- APIs: `/api/reports`, `/api/shelters`, `/api/alerts`, `/api/translate`, `/api/risk-prediction`, `/api/emergency-trends`, `/api/crisis-monitoring`

---

## 16. Speaker Notes (Optional)
- Emphasize real-world scenarios (floods, fires, earthquakes)
- Show how AI output fields map to response decisions
- Clarify fallbacks when integrations are not configured
