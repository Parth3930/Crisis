Emergency Report (Test File)

Suggested Title:
Multi-vehicle collision with fire near central bus terminal

Detailed Description (copy this into the Description field):
At approximately 14:25 local time, I witnessed a three-vehicle collision at the intersection near the Central Bus Terminal. One sedan caught fire in the engine bay with visible flames and heavy smoke. A small fuel spill is present on the roadway. Two occupants appear injured; one is semi-conscious with head trauma, and another has a possible leg fracture. A third person is walking but bleeding from the forearm.

Immediate hazards include:
- Active engine fire and dense smoke
- Possible fuel leakage (petrol/gasoline odor)
- Debris on the road causing secondary collision risk
- Traffic congestion blocking access for emergency vehicles

Immediate needs:
- Fire suppression (1 fire engine with foam capability)
- Medical support (2 ambulances + trauma kits)
- Traffic control and road closure (police units)

Actions taken:
- Warned approaching vehicles to slow down
- Kept safe distance (~50 meters upwind)
- Advised bystanders not to move the injured unless fire spreads

Additional context:
- Wind is moderate; smoke drifting east across inbound lanes
- No visible downed power lines
- Nearby hydrant ~30 meters north side of intersection
